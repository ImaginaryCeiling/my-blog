Great Workout, felt really solid.

Starting out the first 3 400s felt really good. Hit pace on every single one of them (except for the first one but that had extenuating circumstances)

First tempo felt very good as well, me and Camryn led the group. First mile was 6:46 and we were on pace to hit 6:34 for the second one.

Second set of 3x400 was also good; we hit pace on every single one. I forced the younger runners to pace, and they had a tendency to go too fast on the first half and slower on the second one but you learn by doing. 

Second tempo I sped up to about 6:20 and still felt comfortable. I slowed down a bit from 1-1.5 to run with Vrishank who was behind me but close to dropping. He kept up well.

Third set of 3x400s felt amazing as well. Hit 62 on the first one and exactly on pace for the other two. 

Great workout overall. I think I would like to start hitting faster times during workouts now.

Rest and recovery went great. More details to come later.
