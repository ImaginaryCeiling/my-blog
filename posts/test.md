## Workout Rating: 6.8/10

### Comments

Getting stronger but still not satisfied with where I’m at. It will take time and there is nothing to do now but keep my head down and keep working.

Finally made it through a workout without something catastrophic happening so that’s a plus.

Felt strong and controlled through reps 1-3. The last portion of Rep 4 I started feeling a little bit out of control. 5-6 were pure pain; legs and chest both hurt a lot but I pushed through. The 6th rep I got a really bad side stitch down the hill and had to jog a little bit of it but I went all out after getting down the hill.

I was scared of the first rep being fast but it felt good to kickstart the workout with something like that.

During the warmup I felt horrible, both Achilles were tightening every step. Really did not know if I would be able to run or not. I figured I would finish 1 rep and reevaluate; luckily everything felt good once running. I wonder if it is something mental as a way to “prepare” my body? Regardless, everything feels fine now which is a good sign. We will know for sure tomorrow.

### What Next?

- Sleep, eat, recover.
- Start doing more aerobic pool stuff
- Keep working

### What went well

- Made it through a workout albeit with minor problems
- Good food intake throughout the day
- Better time management while working - directly correlates to better sleep

### What I can do better

- More water. I’m filling my water bottle 3-4 times a day but it still might not be enough.
- Get more comfortable being uncomfortable; it won’t get easier at any point.
- Focus on myself more.
